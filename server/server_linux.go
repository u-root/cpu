// cpud can run in one of three modes
// o init
// o daemon started by init
// o manager of one cpu session.
// It is *critical* that the session manager have a private
// name space, else every cpu session will interfere with every
// other session's mounts. What's the best way to ensure the manager
// gets a private name space, and ensure that no improper use
// of this package will result in NOT having a private name space?
// How do we make the logic failsafe?
//
// It turns out there is no harm in always privatizing the name space,
// no matter the mode.
// So in this init function, we do not parse flags (that breaks tests;
// flag.Parse() in init is a no-no), and then, no
// matter what, privatize the namespace, and mount a private /tmp/cpu if we
// are not pid1. As for pid1 tasks, they should be specified by the cpud
// itself, not this package. This code merely ensures correction operation
// of cpud no matter what mode it is invoked in.
