// This is init code for the case that cpu finds itself as pid 1.
// This is duplicative of the real init, but we're implementing it
// as a duplicate so we can get some idea of:
// what an init package should have
// what an init interface should have
// So we take a bit of duplication now to better understand these
// things. We also assume for now this is a busybox environment.
// It is unusual (I guess?) for cpu to be an init in anything else.
// So far, the case for an init pkg is not as strong as I thought
// it might be.
